Due to the abundance of online text data, document summarization has become crucial for efficiently and accurately extracting relevant information from a piece of text.
Over the past few, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown unique abilities for many NLP tasks, including document summarization.
Recent developments have demonstrated remarkable improvements in the relevancy of summaries generated and the computational resources utilized by LLMs.

Even after the rapid growth of these models, one of the significant limitations of LLMs is their context size, which disallows them from working on long documents.
The purpose of summarization is to remove redundancies from a text to allow us to get the key points quickly; this makes summarizing long documents more critical than ever.

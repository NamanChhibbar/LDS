\section{Conclusion}

Our experiments shows a huge jump in BERTScore compared to Unlimiformer on
documents with word counts upto 100,000.
This shows that our pipelines are able utilize details of long text efficiently.
Even though our ROUGE-2 scores are lower than the baselines, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L
scores are competitive.
Since BERTScore is a better metric for capturing semantic similarity, we hypothesize
our pipelines are able to generate better summaries than baselines with higher
ROUGE scores.

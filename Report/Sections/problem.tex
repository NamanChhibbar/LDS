\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Our goal is to summarize a long document of theoretically indefinite length.
Practically, the document length may be up to \textbf{ten times} the context size
of the model used.
We aim to reduce the summary length to about 500 words, preserving maximal
information and coherence.

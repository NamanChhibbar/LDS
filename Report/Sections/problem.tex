\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Our goal is to pre-process and manipulate a long document (with theoretically indefinite length) such that it fits within the context size of the model while retaining important information.
Practically, we have noticed that the document length may be up to \textbf{ten times} the context size of the model used.
For our experiments, we aim to reduce the summary length to about 400 words or less, preserving maximal salient information and coherence.

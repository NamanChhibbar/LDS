\section{Problem Statement}
	\label{sec:problem}

	Our goal is to distill a long document (with theoretically indefinite length) such that it fits
	within the context size of the model while retaining important information.
	Practically, the document length may be up to \textbf{ten times} the context size of the model
	used.
	For our experiments, we aim to reduce the summary length to about 400 words or less, preserving
	maximal information and coherence.

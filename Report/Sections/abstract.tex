Daily, a vast amount of data is added to the internet, especially textual data
consisting of natural language.
Utilizing and interpreting these amounts of data can be time-consuming and cumbersome.
Text summarization is an important task that can relieve such hindrances by
distilling these texts into manageable amounts.
Although many LLMs have excelled in summarization, they are constrained by their
input size, which prevents them from processing longer texts.
This prevents the extraction of relevant information from extensive texts, where
summarization is valuable due to the increased time required for processing.
Our study proposes three novel algorithms to overcome input size limitations,
allowing us to summarize long documents efficiently.

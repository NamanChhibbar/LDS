Daily, a vast amount of textual data is added to the internet, making utilizing
and interpreting textual data cumbersome.
Hence, text summarization is crucial for efficiently extracting relevant information.
Although many LLMs have excelled in summarization, they are constrained by their
input size, which prevents them from processing longer texts.
This prevents extracting relevant information from extensive texts, where
summarization is valuable due to the increased time required for processing.
This study proposes three novel algorithms to overcome input size limitations,
allowing LLMs to summarize long documents efficiently.

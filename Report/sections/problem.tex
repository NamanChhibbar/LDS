\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}

Our goal is to pre-process and distill a long document (with theoretically indefinite length) such that it fits within the context size of the model while retaining important information.
In our experiments, we use documents with lengths of up to \textbf{seventeen times} the context size of the model and aim to reduce the summary length to about 400 words or less, preserving maximal salient information and coherence.

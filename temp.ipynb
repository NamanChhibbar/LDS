      "The Global Financial Crisis: Analysis and Policy Implications Section Recent Developments1:\n",
      "January 27 President Obama pledged to divert $30 billion of money repaid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program to smaller banks to help them make loans to small businesses.\n",
      "September 24-25 At the Group of 20 Summit held in Pittsburgh, world leaders agreed to make the G-20 the leading forum for coordinating global economic policy; not to withdraw stimulus measures until a durable recovery is in place; to co-ordinate their exit strategies from the stimulus measures; to harmonize macroeconomic policies to avoid imbalances (America's deficits and Asia's savings glut) that worsened the financial crisis; and to eliminate subsidies on fossil fuels (only in the medium term).\n",
      "In trade, there was only a weak commitment to get the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations at the World Trade Organizations back on track by 2010, and for the International Monetary Fund, the leaders pledged to provide the \"under-represented\" mostly developing countries at least 5% more of the voting rights by 2011 The other large institutional change was the ascension of the Financial Stability Board, a group of central bankers and financial regulators, to take a lead role in coordinating and monitoring tougher financial regulations and serve, along with the International Monetary Fund, as an early-warning system for emerging risks.\n",
      "Section The Global Financial Crisis and U.S Interests2:\n",
      "Policymaking to deal with the global financial crisis and ensuing global recession has now moved from containing the contagion to specific actions aimed at promoting recovery and changing regulations to prevent a reoccurrence of the problem.\n",
      "This report provides an overview of the global aspects of the financial crisis, how it developed, proposals for regulatory change, and a review of how the crisis is affecting other regions of the world.\n",
      "Global Insight expects world GDP to be at a below-trend pace of about 2.8% in 2010, after having contracted by 2.0% in 2009 with the economies of Greater China and the United States leading the recovery.\n",
      "The overall issue seems to be how to ensure the smooth and efficient functioning of financial markets to promote the general well-being of the country while protecting taxpayer interests and facilitating business operations without creating a moral hazard.\n",
      "Congress also plays a role in measures to reform the international financial system, in recapitalizing international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, in replenishing funds for poverty reduction arms of the World Bank (International Development Association) and regional development banks, and in providing economic and humanitarian assistance to countries in need.\n",
      "As it ballooned into a global financial and economic crisis, some of the largest and most venerable banks, investment houses, and insurance companies have either declared bankruptcy or have had to be rescued financially.\n",
      "The crisis exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide, and despite coordinated easing of monetary policy by governments, trillions of dollars in intervention by central banks and governments, and large fiscal stimulus packages, recovery appears to be just beginning.\n",
      "This financial crisis which began in industrialized countries quickly spread to emerging market and developing economies.\n",
      "For the United States, the financial turmoil touches on the fundamental national interest of protecting the economic security of Americans.\n",
      "It also is affecting the United States in achieving national foreign policy goals, such as maintaining political stability and cooperative relations with other nations and supporting a financial infrastructure that allows for the efficient functioning of the international economy.\n",
      "Reverberations from the financial crisis, moreover, are not only being felt on Wall Street and Main Street but are being manifest in world flows of exports and imports, rates of growth and unemployment, government revenues and expenditures, and in political risk in some countries.\n",
      "The simultaneous slowdown in economic activity around the globe indicates that emerging market and developing economies have not decoupled from industrialized countries and governments cannot depend on exports to pull them out of these recessionary conditions.\n",
      "This global financial and economic crisis has brought to the public consciousness several arcane financial terms usually confined to the domain of regulators and Wall Street investors.\n",
      "Systemic risk (\"Too big to fail\"): The risk that the failure of one or a set of market participants, such as core banks, will reverberate through a financial system and cause severe problems for participants in other sectors.\n",
      "Investors, pension funds, and insurance companies buy CDOs. Credit default swap (CDS): a credit derivative contract between two counterparties in which the buyer makes periodic payments to the seller and in return receives a sum of money if a certain credit event occurs (such as a default in an underlying financial instrument).\n",
      "The global financial crisis has brought home an important point: the United States is still a major center of the financial world.\n",
      "Regional financial crises (such as the Asian financial crisis, Japan's banking crisis, or the Latin American debt crisis) can occur without seriously infecting the rest of the global financial system.\n",
      "The reason is that the United States is the main guarantor of the international financial system, the provider of dollars widely used as currency reserves and as an international medium of exchange, and a contributor to much of the financial capital that sloshes around the world seeking higher yields.\n",
      "The rest of the world may not appreciate it, but a financial crisis in the United States often takes on a global hue.\n",
      "The two largest legislative actions were the Troubled Asset Relief Program aimed at providing support for financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 aimed at providing stimulus to the economy.\n",
      "Policy proposals to change specific regulations as well as the structure of regulation and supervision at both the domestic and international levels have been coming forth through the legislative process, from the Administration, and from recommendations by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund, Bank for International Settlements, and Financial Stability Board (Forum).\n",
      "On June 17, 2009, the Obama administration announced its plan for regulatory reform of the U.S financial system.\n",
      "In Congress, numerous bills have been introduced that deal with issues such as establishing a commission/select committee to investigate causes of the financial crisis, provide oversight and greater accountability of Federal Reserve and Treasury lending activity, deal with problems in the housing and mortgage markets, provide funding for the International Monetary Fund, address problems with consumer credit cards, provide for improved oversight for financial and commodities markets, deal with the U.S national debt, and establish a systemic risk monitor.\n",
      "In an international marketplace of multinational corporations, instant transfers of wealth, lightning fast communications, and globalized trading systems for equities and securities, if U.S regulations are anomalous or significantly more \"burdensome\" than those in other industrialized nations, business and transactions could migrate toward other markets.\n",
      "The vehicle for forming an international consensus on measures to be taken by individual countries is the G-20 along with the International Monetary Fund and new Financial Stability Board (based in Switzerland), although some developing nations prefer the more inclusive G-30 The third G-20 Summit was held in Pittsburgh on September 24-25, 2009 World leaders there focused on tougher regulation of the financial sector, including limits on bonus payments for bankers, and attempted to decide what comes next, now that there are tentative signs of recovery.\n",
      "Among the issues that were on the U.S agenda included measures to ease global economic trade imbalances, to prevent a repeat of financial crises through a process of regular consultations, and to have increased cooperation on policies that will ensure a rebalancing of world growth.\n",
      "The April 2009 G-20 London Summit called for a greater role for the IMF and for it to collaborate with the new Financial Stability Board to provide early warning of macroeconomic and financial risks and actions needed to address them.\n",
      "At the April 2009 G-20 London Summit, a schism arose between the United States and the U.K, who were arguing for large and coordinated stimulus packages, and Germany and France, who considered their automatic stabilizers (increases in government expenditures for items such as unemployment insurance that are triggered any time the economy slows) plus existing stimulus programs as sufficient.\n",
      "In the communiqu, the G-20 leaders decided to add $1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial institutions, including $750 billion for the International Monetary Fund, $250 billion to boost global trade, and $100 billion for multilateral development banks.\n",
      "This increased the U.S quota in the International Monetary Fund by 4.5 billion SDRs ($7.69 billion), provided loans to the IMF of up to an additional 75 billion SDRs ($116.01 billion), and authorized the United States Executive Director of the IMF to vote to approve the sale of up to 12,965,649 ounces of the Fund's gold.\n",
      "A new Financial Services Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation (chaired by Treasury and including the heads of the principal federal financial regulators as members) b.\n",
      "New authority for the Federal Reserve to supervise all firms that could pose a threat to financial stability, even those that do not own banks c.\n",
      "Enhanced regulation of securitization markets, including new requirements for market transparency, stronger regulation of credit rating agencies, and a requirement that issuers and originators retain a financial interest in securitized loans b.\n",
      "A level playing field and higher standards for providers of consumer financial products and services, whether or not they are part of a bank.\n",
      "Treasury proposed international reforms to support U.S efforts, including strengthening the capital framework; improving oversight of global financial markets; coordinating supervision of internationally active firms; and enhancing crisis management tools.\n",
      "In December 2009, the House passed H.R 4173, The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that addresses many of the issues raised by the financial crisis.\n",
      "664 would create a systemic risk monitor for the financial system of the United States, to oversee financial regulatory activities of the federal government, and for other purposes.\n",
      "After the recent bank rescue programs, however, the implication for the financial community is that really large, complex, and highly interconnected financial institutions can count on public support at critical times.\n",
      "S. 386 ( P.L 111-21, Section 5) established a 10-member Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in the legislative branch to examine the causes of the current U.S financial and economic crisis, taking into account fraud and abuse in the financial sector and other specified factors.\n",
      "It authorized $5 million for the Commission and requires the Commission to submit a final report on its findings to the President and Congress on December 15, 2010, requires the Commission chairperson to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs within 120 days after the submission of such report, and terminates the Commission 60 days after the submission of such report.\n",
      "S. 386, Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 or FERA became P.L 111-21 on May 20, 2009 It amends the federal criminal code to include within the definition of \"financial institution\" a mortgage lending business or any person or entity that makes, in whole or in part, a federally related mortgage loan.\n",
      "CFPA's rules would cover all financial providers, including banks, thrifts, credit unions and non-bank financial institutions, such as subprime mortgage lenders.\n",
      "Several bills would provide for oversight, reports, or other investigations into activities related to the financial crisis.\n",
      "H.R 2424, the Federal Reserve Credit Facility Review Act of 2009, would authorize reviews by the Comptroller General of the United States of any credit facility established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any federal reserve bank during the current financial crisis, and for other purposes.\n",
      "The issue of compensation for executives of firms that have received government support during the financial crisis.\n",
      "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Title VII of P.L 111-5 ) restricts the compensation of executives of companies during the period in which any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) remains outstanding and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to develop appropriate standards for executive compensation.\n",
      "1074 would provide for greater influence by shareholders in selecting corporate officers and H.R 3269 (passed the House on July 31, 2009) would authorize federal regulators of financial firms to prohibit incentive pay structures that are seen to encourage inappropriate risk-taking and require them to adopt say on pay.\n",
      "For legislation related to a fiscal stimulus and monetary policy, see CRS Report R40104, Economic Stimulus: Issues and Policies, by [author name scrubbed], [author name scrubbed], and [author name scrubbed], and CRS Report RL34427, Financial Turmoil: Federal Reserve Policy Responses, by [author name scrubbed].\n",
      "For policy related to the IMF, see CRS Report RS22976, The Global Financial Crisis: The Role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) , by [author name scrubbed] and CRS Report R40578, The Global Financial Crisis: Increasing IMF Resources and the Role of Congress, by [author name scrubbed] and [author name scrubbed].\n",
      "Section Four Phases of the Global Financial Crisis:\n",
      "The global financial crisis as it has played out in countries across the globe has been manifest in four overlapping phases.\n",
      "On a microeconomic level, this has entailed actions to resolve immediate problems and effects of the crisis including financial rescue packages for ailing firms, guaranteeing deposits at banks, injections of capital, disposing of toxic assets, and restructuring debt.\n",
      "Actions taken include the rescue of financial institutions considered to be \"too big to fail\" and government takeovers of certain financial institutions, government facilitation of mergers and acquisitions, and government purchases of problem financial assets.\n",
      "The Federal Reserve and Treasury, therefore, have turned toward quantitative monetary easing (buying government securities and injecting more money into the economy) and dealing directly with the toxic assets being held by banks.\n",
      "Even Sweden, often viewed as a successful model of how to cope with a financial crisis, had to take decisive action to deal with the nonperforming assets of its banking system.\n",
      "Under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP, H.R 1424 / P.L 110-343 ), the Treasury has invested in dozens of banks, General Motors, Chrysler and the insurer A.I.G The investments are in the form of preferred stock that pays quarterly dividends.\n",
      "On March 23, 2009, The U.S Treasury released the details of its $900 billion Public Private Partnership Investment Program to address the challenge of toxic (legacy) assets being carried by the financial system.\n",
      "The U.S Federal Reserve also has conducted about $1.2 trillion in emergency commitments to stabilize the financial sector.\n",
      "Its interventions have included a safety net for commercial banks, the rescue of Bear Stearns, a lending facility for investment banks and brokerages, loans for money-market assets and commercial paper, and purchases of securitized loans and lending to businesses and consumers for purchases of asset-backed securities.\n",
      "The second phase of this financial crisis is less uncommon except that the severity of the macroeconomic downturn confronting countries around the world is the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n",
      "The financial crisis soon spread to real sectors to negatively affect whole economies, production, firms, investors, and households.\n",
      "Many of these countries, particularly those with emerging and developing markets, have been pulled down by the ever widening flight of capital from their economies and by falling exports and commodity prices.\n",
      "Figure 1 shows the effect of the financial crisis on economic growth rates (annualized changes in real GDP by quarter) in selected nations of the world.\n",
      "The figure shows the difference between the 2001 recession that was confined primarily to countries such as the United States, Mexico, and Japan and the current financial crisis that is pulling down growth rates in a variety of countries.\n",
      "In July-August 2009, there was a growing consensus among forecasters that the world had seen the worst of the global recession and that economies would hit bottom in 2009 and begin a weak recovery as early as the second half of 2009 On June 24, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development revised its world economic outlook upwards for the first time in two years.\n",
      "On November 14, 2009, Eurostat (the EU's statistics agency) reported that the euro area had officially emerged from recession during the third quarter of 2009 In response to the recession or slowdown in economic growth, many countries have adopted fiscal stimulus packages designed to induce economic recovery or at least keep conditions from worsening.\n",
      "These are summarized in Appendix B and include packages by China ($586 billion), the European Union ($256 billion), Japan ($396 billion), Mexico ($54 billion), and South Korea ($52.5 billion).The global total for stimulus packages now exceeds $2 trillion, but some of the packages include measures that extend into subsequent years, so the total does not imply that the entire amount will translate into immediate government spending.\n",
      "The stimulus packages by definition are to be fiscal measures (government spending or tax cuts) but some packages include measures aimed at stabilizing banks and other financial institutions that usually are categorized as bank rescue or financial assistance packages.\n",
      "The $2 trillion total in stimulus packages amounts to approximately 3% of world gross domestic product, an amount that exceeds the call by the International Monetary Fund for fiscal stimulus totaling 2% of global GDP to counter worsening economic conditions world wide.\n",
      "The IMF estimated that as of January 2009, the U.S fiscal stimulus packages as a percent of GDP in 2009 would amount to 1.9%, for the euro area 0.9%, for Japan 1.4%, for Asia excluding Japan 1.5%, and for the rest of the G-20 countries 1.1%.\n",
      "At the G-20 London Summit, a schism arose between the United States and the U.K, who were arguing for large and coordinated stimulus packages, and Germany and France, who considered their automatic stabilizers (increases in government expenditures for items such as unemployment insurance that are triggered any time the economy slows) plus existing stimulus programs as sufficient.\n",
      "In their communiqu, the leaders noted that $5 trillion will have been devoted to fiscal expansion by the end of 2010 and committed themselves to \"deliver the scale of sustained fiscal effort necessary to restore growth.\" In the communiqu, the G-20 leaders decided to add $1.1 trillion in resources to the international financial institutions, including $750 billion more for the International Monetary Fund, $250 billion to boost global trade, and $100 billion for multilateral development banks.\n",
      "The additional lending by the international financial institutions would be in addition to national fiscal stimulus efforts and could be targeted to those countries most in need.\n",
      "Some observers have raised the possibility of a sovereign debt crisis (countries defaulting on government guaranteed debt) or as in the case of Iceland having to nationalize its banks and assume liabilities greater than the size of the national economy.\n",
      "Since November 1, 2008, the IMF, under its Stand-By Arrangement facility, has provided or is in the process of providing financial support packages for Iceland ($2.1 billion), Ukraine ($16.4 billion), Hungary ($25.1 billion), Pakistan ($7.6 billion), Belarus ($2.46 billion), Serbia ($530.3 million), Armenia ($540 million), El Salvador ($800 million), Latvia ($2.4 billion), Seychelles ($26.6 million), Mongolia ($229.2 million), Costa Rica ($735 million), Guatemala ($935 million), and Romania ($17.1 billion).\n",
      "(See \" Policy and Legislation,\" above.) In order to coordinate reforms in national regulatory systems and give such proposals political backing, world leaders began a series of international meetings to address changes in policy, regulations, oversight, and enforcement.\n",
      "The G-20 leaders' Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy that met on November 15, 2008, in Washington, DC, was the first of a series of summits to address these issues.\n",
      "Much of this involves the technicalities of regulation and oversight of financial markets, derivatives, and hedging activity, as well as standards for capital adequacy and a schema for funding and conducting future financial interventions, if necessary.\n",
      "Avoiding regulatory policies that exacerbate the ups and downs of the business cycle; Reviewing and aligning global accounting standards, particularly for complex securities in times of stress; Strengthening transparency of credit derivatives markets and reducing their systemic risks; Reviewing incentives for risk-taking and innovation reflected in compensation practices; and Reviewing the mandates, governance, and resource requirements of the International Financial Institutions.\n",
      "These organizations include the InternationalAccounting Standards Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the Financial Stability Forum (Board).\n",
      "At the London Summit, the leaders addressed the issue of coordination and oversight of the international financial system by establishing a new Financial Stability Board (FSB) with a strengthened mandate as a successor to the Financial Stability Forum with membership to include all G-20 countries, Financial Stability Forum members, Spain, and the European Commission.\n",
      "The Summit left it to individual countries to reshape regulatory systems to identify and take account of macro-prudential (systemic) risks, but agreed to regulate hedge funds and Credit Rating Agencies.\n",
      "For the United States, the fundamental issues may be the degree to which U.S laws and regulations are to be altered to conform to recommendations from the new Financial Stability Board and what authority the Board and IMF will have relative to member nations.\n",
      "Although the London Summit strengthened regulations and the IMF, it did not result in a \"new international financial architecture.\" The question still is out as to whether the Bretton Woods system should be changed from one in which the United States is the buttress of the international financial architecture to one in which the United States remains the buttress but its financial markets are more \"Europeanized\" (more in accord with Europe's practices) and more constrained by the broader international financial order?\n",
      "For the United States, some of these issues are being addressed by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets (consisting of the U.S Treasury Secretary, Chairs of the Federal Reserve Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission) in cooperation with international financial organizations.\n",
      "Among the proposals put forward by the Treasury but not mentioned by the G-20 included creating a single regulator with responsibility over all systemically important financial institutions with power for prompt corrective action, strengthening regulation of critical payment systems, processing all standardized over-the-counter derivatives through a regulated clearing house and subjecting them to a strong regulatory regime, and providing authority for a government agency to take over a failing, systemically important non-bank institution and place it in conservatorship or receivership outside the bankruptcy system.\n",
      "(For the June 17, 2009, Obama Administration proposal for financial market regulation, see the \" Policy \" section of this report.)\n",
      "For example, on February 12, 2009, the U.S Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, told Congress that instability in countries around the world caused by the global economic crisis and its geopolitical implications, rather than terrorism, is the primary near-term security threat to the United States.\n",
      "The IMF has approved a $7.6 billion loan package for Pakistan, but the country faces serious economic problems at a time when it is dealing with challenges from suspected al Qaeda and Taliban sympathizers, when citizen objections are rising to U.S missile strikes on suspected terrorist targets in Pakistan, and the country faces a budget shortfall that may curtail the ability of the government to continue its counterterror operations.\n",
      "Most nations view the current financial crisis as having been created by the financial elite in New York and London in cooperation with their increasingly laissez faire governments.\n",
      "By blaming the industrialized West, particularly the United States, for their economic woes, governments can stoke the fires of nationalism and seek support for themselves.\n",
      "Although the market-based structure of most of the world economies is likely to continue, the basic philosophy of deregulation, non-governmental intervention in the private sector, and free and open markets for goods, services, and capital, seems to be subsumed by the need to increase regulation of new financial products, increased government intervention, and some pull-back from further reductions in trade barriers.\n",
      "State capitalism in which governments either nationalize or own shares of companies and intervene to direct parts of their operations is rising not only in countries such as Russia, where a history of command economics predisposes governments toward state ownership of the means of production, but in the United States, Europe, and Asia.\n",
      "Nationalization of banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions, as well as government capital injections and loans to private corporations have become parts of rescue and stimulus packages and have brought politicians and bureaucrats directly into economic decision-making at the company level.\n",
      "Still, whether it be provisions to buy domestic products instead of imports, financial assistance to domestic producers, or export incentives, countries have been attempting to protect national companies often at the expense of those foreign.\n",
      "The WTO also compiled a list of new trade and trade-related policy measures that had been taken since September 2008 These included increases in steel tariffs by India, increases in tariffs on 940 imported products by Ecuador, restrictions on ports of entry for imports of certain consumer goods by Indonesia, imposition of non-automatic licensing requirements on products considered as sensitive by Argentina, increase in tariffs on imports of crude oil by South Korea, re-introduction of export subsidies for certain dairy products by the European Commission, and a rise in import duties on cars and trucks by Russia.\n",
      "According to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, an independent London think tank, between the G-20 Summit in November 2008 and November 2009, the governments of the world implemented 297 discriminatory trade measures, of which 184 were by the G-20 member states.\n",
      "The China has announced a number of policy responses to deal with the crisis, including a pledge to spend $586 billion to boost domestic spending.\n",
      "Even though the provision applies only to steel, iron, and manufactured goods used in government funded construction projects and language was included that the provision \"shall be applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations under international agreements,\" many nations have protested the Buy America language as \"protectionist\" and as possibly starting down a slippery slope that could lead to WTO-inconsistent protectionism by countries.\n",
      "Another issue raised by the global financial crisis has been the role of the United States on the world stage and the U.S leadership position relative to other countries.\n",
      "On one hand, many blame the United States for the crisis and see it as yet another of the excesses of a country that had emerged as the sole superpower in a unipolar world following the end of the Cold War. Although not always explicit, their willingness to follow the U.S lead appears to have diminished.\n",
      "The combination of U.S military power, extensive economic and financial clout, its diplomatic clout, and its veto power in the IMF has put the United States at the center of any resolution to the global financial turmoil.\n",
      "During the early phase of the crisis, European leaders (particularly British Prime Minister [author name scrubbed], French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel) played a major role and were influential in crafting international mechanisms and policies to deal with initial adverse effects of the crisis as well as proposing long-term solutions.\n",
      "Also, dealing with the financial crisis has enabled countries with rich currency reserves, such as China, Russia, and Japan, to assume higher political profiles in world financial circles.\n",
      "As China helps to finance budget deficits in the United States and as Beijing increasingly sees its economic and financial system as \"superior\" to that of the West, Washington appears to be losing leverage with China on issues such as climate change, human and labor rights, and product safety.\n",
      "Also, the inclusion of China, India, and Brazil in the G-20 Summits rather than just the G-7 or G-8 countries as originally proposed, reflects the growing influence of the non-industrialized nations in addressing global financial issues.\n",
      "These include the International Monetary Fund, the Financial Stability Board (an enlarged Financial Stability Forum), the Group of Twenty (G-20), the Bank for International Settlements, the World Bank, the Group of 7 (G-7), and other organizations that play a role in coordinating policy among nations, provide early warning of impending crises, or assist countries as a lender of last resort.\n",
      "However, the interconnectedness of global financial and economic markets has highlighted the need for stronger institutions to coordinate regulatory policy across nations, provide early warning of dangers caused by systemic, cyclical, or macroprudential risks and induce corrective actions by national governments.\n",
      "As a result of the global financial crisis, the IMF has expanded its activities along several dimensions.\n",
      "The IMF also tracks world economic and financial developments more closely and provides countries with the forecasts and analysis of developments in financial markets.\n",
      "It additionally provides policy advice to countries and regions and is assisting the G-20 with recommendations to reshape the system of international regulation and governance.\n",
      "Although the London Summit provided for more funding for the IMF and international development banks, some larger issues, such as governance of and reform of the IMF are now being determined.\n",
      "This increased the U.S quota in the International Monetary Fund by 4.5 billion SDRs ($7.69 billion), provided loans to the IMF of up to an additional 75 billion SDRs ($116.01 billion), and authorized the United States Executive Director of the IMF to vote to approve the sale of up to 12,965,649 ounces of the Fund's gold.\n",
      "This signing statement has been addressed in H.Amdt 311 to H.R 3081, the Fiscal 2010 State-Foreign Operations spending bill passed on July 7, 2009 The Washington Action Plan from the G-20 Leader's Summit in November 2008 contained specific policy changes that were addressed in the April 2, 2009 Summit in London.\n",
      "The regulatory and other specific changes have been assigned to existing international organizations such as the Financial Stability Forum (now Financial Stability Board) and Bank for International Settlements, as well as international standard setting bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, InternationalAccounting Standards Board, International Organization of Securities Commissions, and International Association of Insurance Supervisors.\n",
      "The decline in tax revenues caused by the slowdown in economic activity also is increasing competition within countries for scarce budget funds and affecting decisions about the allocation of national resources.\n",
      "In the United States, the economic downturn and the vast resources being committed to provide stimulus to the U.S economy and rescue trouble financial institutions could clash with some policy priorities of the new Administration.\n",
      "However, financial constraints could impose difficult choices between foreign policy prioritiesfor example, between boosting levels of non-military aid to Afghanistan and increasing global health programsor changes to planned levels of increases across the board.\n",
      "The global reach of the economic downturn further complicates the resource problem, as it both limits what other countries can do to address common international challenges and potentially exacerbates the scale of need in conflict areas and the developing world.\n",
      "The actions of the United States and other nations in coping with the global financial crisis first aimed to contain the contagion, minimize losses to society, restore confidence in financial institutions and instruments, and lubricate the economic system in order for it to return to full operation.\n",
      "The goal is to change the regulatory structure and regulations, the global financial architecture, and some of the imbalances in trade and capital flows to ensure that future crises do not occur or, at least, to mitigate their effects.\n",
      "Judging from policy proposals to cope with the financial crisis in both the United States and in Europe, it appears that solutions are taking a multipronged approach.\n",
      "They are being aimed at the different levels in which financial markets operate: globally, nationally, and by specific financial sector.\n",
      "Since financial crises occur even in relatively tightly regulated economies, the likelihood that a supranational authority could prevent an international crisis from occurring is questionable.\n",
      "The financial crisis has been a \"wake-up call\" for investors who had confidence in, for example, credit ratings placed on securities by credit rating agencies operating under what some have referred to as \"perverse incentives and conflicts of interest.\" Between 2007 and November 2009, for example, the credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's, has downgraded nearly $1.5 trillion of U.S residential-mortgage-backed bonds from AAA to junk.\n",
      "The financial crisis crossed national boundaries and spread from individual financial institutions to the wider economy.\n",
      "Not only did countries of the world not directly complicit in the original financial problems suffer \"collateral damage,\" but the ensuing downturn in economic activity affected millions of \"innocent bystanders\" because of their being connected through trade, financial, and investment flows.\n",
      "To some extent, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, or the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development monitored the global economy, but they tended to focus on macroeconomic flows and not on macroprudential regulation.\n",
      "The global financial crisis resulted from a confluence of factors and processes at both the macro-financial level (across financial sectors) and at the micro-financial level (the behavior of individual institutions and the functioning of specific market segments).\n",
      "This is microprudential regulation under which no single regulator possesses all of the information and authority necessary to monitor systemic and synergistic risk or the potential that seemingly isolated events could lead to broad dislocation and a financial crisis so widespread that it affects the real economy.\n",
      "The role of the systemic regulator should include gathering, analyzing, and reporting information about significant interactions between and risks among financial institutions; designing and implementing systemically sensitive regulations, including capital requirements; and coordinating with the fiscal authorities and other government agencies in managing systemic crises.\n",
      "Unless the regulatory framework and the supervisory arrangements in the United States, Europe, and other large financial centers are broadly compatible with each other, business may flow from the United States to the area of minimal regulation and supervision.\n",
      "The interconnectedness of financial centers across the world also implies that systemic risk can be amplified because of actions occurring in different countries, often out of sight or reach of national regulators.\n",
      "One challenge is that the world economy depends greatly on large financial (and other) institutions that may be deemed \"too large to fail.\" If an institution is considered to be \"too big to fail,\" its bankruptcy would pose a significant risk to the system as a whole.\n",
      "For other nations of the world, what has become clear from the crisis is that U.S financial ailments can be highly contagious.\n",
      "Foreign financial institutions are not immune to ill health in American banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies.\n",
      "The financial services industry links together investors and financial institutions in disparate countries around the world.\n",
      "In the second phase of the financial crisis, markets all over the world have been experiencing historic declines.\n",
      "The policymakers can be divided between those of national governments and, to an extent, those of international institutions, but the resulting policy implementation, oversight, and regulation almost all rest in national governments (as well as sub-national governments such as states, e.g New York, for insurance regulation).\n",
      "They tend to operate in all major markets and congregate around world financial centers (i.e, London, New York, Zurich, Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo, and Shanghai) where client portfolios often are based and where institutions and qualified professionals exist to support their activities.\n",
      "Financial meltdowns have occurred in countries ranging from Sweden to Argentina, from Russia to Korea, from the United Kingdom to Indonesia, and from Japan to the United States.\n",
      "In general, crises have been generated by factors such as an overshooting of markets, excessive leveraging of debt, credit booms, miscalculations of risk, rapid outflows of capital from a country, mismatches between asset types (e.g, short-term dollar debt used to fund long-term local currency loans), unsustainable macroeconomic policies, off-balance sheet operations by banks, inexperience with new financial instruments, and deregulation without sufficient market monitoring and oversight.\n",
      "As shown in Figure 2, the current crisis harkens back to the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis in which Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea had to borrow from the International Monetary Fund to service their short-term foreign debt and to cope with a dramatic drop in the values of their currency and deteriorating financial condition.\n",
      "By mid-2008, world currency reserves by governments had reached $4.4 trillion with China's reserves alone approaching $2 trillion, Japan's nearly $1 trillion, Russia's more than $500 billion, and India, South Korea, and Brazil each with more than $200 billion.\n",
      "The accumulation of hard currency assets was so great in some countries that they diverted some of their reserves into sovereign wealth funds that were to invest in higher yielding assets than U.S Treasury and other government securities.\n",
      "Following the Asian financial crisis, much of the world's \"hot money\" began to flow into high technology stocks.\n",
      "A problem was that the mortgage originators often were mortgage finance companies whose main purpose was to write mortgages using funds provided by banks and other financial institutions or borrowed.\n",
      "These are a type of insurance contract (a financial derivative) that lenders purchase against the possibility of credit event (a default on a debt obligation, bankruptcy, restructuring, or credit rating downgrade) associated with debt, a borrowing institution, or other referenced entity.\n",
      "The origins of the financial crisis point toward three developments that increased risk in financial markets.\n",
      "Regulation in the United States tends to be functional with separate government agencies regulating and overseeing banks, securities, insurance, and futures.\n",
      "Certain countries incurred large deficits in international trade and current accounts (particularly the United States), while other countries accumulated large reserves of foreign exchange by running surpluses in those accounts.\n",
      "These were joined by a huge run up in the price of commodities, rising interest rates to combat the threat of inflation, a general slowdown in world economic growth rates, and increased globalization that allowed for rapid communication, instant transfers of funds, and information networks that fed a herd instinct.\n",
      "An immediate indicator of the rapidity and spread of the financial crisis has been in stock market values.\n",
      "By mid-October 2008, the stock indices for the United States, U.K, Japan, and Russia had fallen by nearly half or more relative to their levels on October 1, 2007 The downward slide reached a bottom in mid-March 2009, although there still is concern that the subsequent slow recovery in stock values has been a \"bear market bounce\" and that these stock markets may again go into sustained decline the close tracking of the equities markets in the United States, Japan, and the U.K provides further evidence of the global nature of capital markets and the rapidity of international capital flows.\n",
      "Declines in stock market values reflected huge changes in expectations and the flight of capital from assets in countries deemed to have even small increases in risk.\n",
      "Dramatic declines in stock values coincided with new accounting rules that required financial institutions holding stock as part of their capital base to value that stock according to market values (mark-to-market).\n",
      "One indicator of the trust among financial institutions is the Libor, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate.\n",
      "Although it is a composite of primarily European interest rates, it forms the basis for many financial contracts world wide including U.S home mortgages and student loans.\n",
      "As the financial crisis hit, investors fled stocks and debt instruments for the relative safety of cashoften held in the form of U.S Treasury or other government securities.\n",
      "That increased demand for dollars, decreased the U.S interest rate needed to attract investors, and caused a jump in inflows of liquid capital into the United States.\n",
      "The greater burden of debt servicing usually has combined with a weakening capital base of banks because of declines in stock market values to further add to the financial woes of countries.\n",
      "As economies weakened, governments moved from shoring up their financial institutions to coping with rapidly developing recessionary economic conditions.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter of 2008, economic growth rates dropped in some countries at rates not seen in decades.(See Figure 1 ) China alone has estimated that 20 million workers have become unemployed.\n",
      "The global credit crunch that began in August 2007 has led to a financial crisis in emerging market countries ( see box ) that is being viewed as greater in both scope and effect than the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 or the Latin American debt crisis of 2001-2002, although the impact on individual countries may have been greater in previous crises.\n",
      "Of the emerging market countries, those in Central and Eastern Europe appear, to date, to be the most impacted by the financial crisis.\n",
      "The ability of emerging market countries to borrow from global capital markets has allowed many countries to experience incredibly high growth rates.\n",
      "However, since this economic expansion was predicated on the continued availability of access to foreign credit, they were highly vulnerable to a financial crisis when credit lines dried up.\n",
      "On a wide variety of economic indicators, such as the total amount of debt in the economy, the size of current account deficits, dependence on foreign investment, and the level of indebtedness in the domestic banking sector, countries such as Hungary, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, rank among the highest of all emerging markets.\n",
      "Due to the impact of the financial crisis, several Central and Eastern European countries have already sought emergency lending from the IMF to help finance their balance of payments.\n",
      "On November 3, a staff-level agreement on an IMF loan was reached with Kyrgyzstan, and on November 24, the IMF approved a $7.6 billion stand-by arrangement for Pakistan to support the country's economic stabilization.\n",
      "Since the Asian financial crisis, many Asian emerging market economies enacted a policy of foreign reserve accumulation as a form of self-insurance in case they once again faced a \"sudden stop\" of capital flows and the subsequent financial and balance of payments crises that result from a rapid tightening of international credit flows.\n",
      "Some countries, particularly China and certain oil exporters, also established sovereign wealth funds that invested the foreign exchange reserves in assets that promised higher yields.\n",
      "While global trade and finance linkages between the emerging markets and the industrialized countries have continued to deepen over the past decade, many analysts believed that emerging markets had successfully \"decoupled\" their growth prospects from those of industrialized countries.\n",
      "Proponents of the theory of decoupling argued that emerging market countries, especially in Eastern Europe and Asia, have successfully developed their own economies and intra-emerging market trade and finance to such an extent that a slowdown in the United States or Europe would not have as dramatic an impact as it did a decade ago.\n",
      "In particular, [emerging market] countries have diversified their economies, attained high growth rates and increasingly become important players in the global economy.\n",
      "Despite efforts at self-insurance through reserve accumulation and evidence of economic decoupling, the U.S financial crisis, and the sharp contraction of credit and global capital flows in October 2008 affected all emerging markets to a degree due to their continued dependence on foreign capital flows.\n",
      "A key to understanding why emerging market countries have been so affected by the crisis (especially Central and Eastern Europe) is their high dependence on foreign capital flows to finance their economic growth ( Figures 7-8 ).\n",
      "For countries such as those in Central and Eastern Europe which have both high gross and net capital flows, vulnerability to financial crisis is even higher.\n",
      "Once the crisis occurred, it became much more difficult for emerging market countries to continue to finance their foreign debt.\n",
      "As emerging markets have grown, Western financial institutions have increased their investments in emerging markets.\n",
      "G-10 financial institutions have a total of $4.7 trillion of exposure to emerging markets with $1.6 trillion to Central and Eastern Europe, $1.5 trillion to emerging Asia, and $1.0 trillion to Latin America.\n",
      "While industrialized nation bank debt to emerging markets represents a relatively small percentage (13%) of total cross-border bank lending ($36.9 trillion as of September 2008), this figure is disproportionately high for European financial institutions and their lending to Central and Eastern Europe.\n",
      "For European and U.K banks, cross-border lending to emerging markets, primarily Central and Eastern Europe accounts for between 21% and 24% of total lending.\n",
      "The heavy debt to Western financial institutions greatly increased central and Eastern Europe's vulnerability to contagion from the financial crisis.\n",
      "First, as substantiated earlier in this report, it originated in the United States, with Latin America suffering shocks created by collapses in the U.S housing and credit markets, despite minimal direct exposure to the \"toxic\" assets in question.\n",
      "Second, it spread to Latin America in spite of recent strong economic growth and policy improvements that have generally increased economic stability and reduced risk factors, particularly in the financial sector.\n",
      "Repercussions from the global financial crisis have varied by country based in part on policy differences, but also on exposure to two major risks, the degree of reliance on the U.S economy, and/or dependence on commodity exports.\n",
      "A year after the crisis began, however, it appears that the financial and economic repercussions have stabilized, and that in many Latin American countries, a return to growth is evident.\n",
      "While the downturn was, and still is, very severe by many measures, relatively sound macroeconomic fundamentals and policy responses by many Latin American countries and international financial organizations may have ameliorated what could have been a deeper and longer regional decline.\n",
      "The economies of Latin America and the Caribbean grew at an average annual rate of nearly 5.5% for the five years 2004-2008, lending credence to the once prominent idea that they were \"decoupling\" from slower growing developed economies, particularly the United States.\n",
      "Domestic policy reforms have been credited with achieving macroeconomic stability, stronger fiscal positions, sounder banking systems, and lower sovereign debt risk levels.\n",
      "The sharp rise in commodity prices, supportive external financing conditions, and high levels of remittances contributed greatly to the region's improved economic welfare, reflecting gains from a strong global economy.\n",
      "In addition, all three trends reversed even before the financial crisis began, suggesting that Latin America remains very much tied to world markets and trends.\n",
      "In Mexico and Brazil, where firms took large speculative off-balance sheet derivative positions in the currency markets, currency losses were compounded to a degree requiring central bank intervention to ensure dollar availability.\n",
      "Signs of financial market stabilization appeared by the summer of 2009 Both regional stock and currency indexes recovered 60% of their losses by September 2009, indicating renewed interest and confidence in Latin America's ability to weather the downturn and perhaps emerge from it ahead of many developed economies, including the United States.\n",
      "In each of these countries, bond spreads rose to over 1,500 basis points as the crisis unfolded, and although the spreads have narrowed to a range of 750 to 950 basis points, the difference still reflects a lack of confidence in their financials systems and their capacity to service debt.\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), Andean Development Corporation (CAF), and Latin American Reserve Fund (LARF) have all increased lending to the region, particularly on an expedited and short-term basis.\n",
      "The United States took steps to provide dollar liquidity (reciprocal currency \"swap\" arrangement) on a temporary bilateral basis to many central banks of \"systemically important\" countries with sound banking systems.\n",
      "In Latin America, this group includes Mexico and Brazil, each of which had access to a $30 billion currency swap reserve with the U.S Federal Reserve System, initially through April 30, 2009, but which was extended to February 1, 2010 The swap arrangement is intended to ensure dollar availability in support of the large trade and investment transactions conducted with the United States, and perhaps more importantly, reinforce confidence in the financial systems of the two largest Latin American economies.\n",
      "National governments are also relying on monetary, fiscal, and exchange rate policies to stimulate their economies.\n",
      "The Mexican economy contracted for four consecutive quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, and the government forecasts an economic decline of 7%-8% for 2009 This would be the worst recession in six decades, making Mexico the hardest hit country in Latin America.\n",
      "Output fell in both industry and service sectors, with the 13% decline in industrial production over the past year the worst recorded since the 1995 \"peso crisis.\" Remittances, which amounted to $25 billion in 2008, may fall by 15% in 2009 Mexico faces a number of problems: heavy reliance on the U.S economy, falling foreign investment, and low (until recently) oil prices, and declining oil output, the largest source of national revenue.\n",
      "Analysts are forecasting a sharp increase in economic growth in the second half of 2009, with an annual expansion in economic activity of 3.3% for 2010 The sustainability of such a trend will depend heavily on recovery of the U.S and global economies.\n",
      "The Mexican government responded by selling billions of dollars of reserves and using a temporary currency swap arrangement with the U.S Federal Reserve to assure dollar liquidity, but the peso remains the hardest hit of all emerging market currencies.\n",
      "In the non-financial sectors, industrial production was severely hit by the fall in U.S demand for Mexican exports.\n",
      "Because Mexico's trade is poorly diversified, the effects of the U.S downturn were particularly noticeable, with Mexican exports to the United States on a monthly basis falling 37% from October 2008 to February 2009, hitting the lowest level since January 2005 U.S imports from Mexico began to recover in June 2009, and are up nearly 15% from February 2009, but stand at only 70% of the peak reached in October 2007 The trade effect has been compounded by a nearly 20% annual decline in remittances from Mexican workers living in the United States.\n",
      "The central government has increased liquidity in the banking system, including multiple cuts in the prime policy lending rate.\n",
      "It has also increased its credit lines with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and Inter-American Development Bank.\n",
      "Recent downward revisions of Mexico's credit rating (still investor grade) reflect growing concern over Mexico's financial position in light of weak economic fundamentals and Mexico's recovery relying so heavily on a U.S economic rebound.\n",
      "Brazil entered the financial crisis from a position of relative macroeconomic and fiscal strength, and although it has not been immune to the global contraction, data suggest Brazil will experience only a two-quarter recession, with recovery solidly in place by in the second half of 2009 The economy grew by 5.1% in 2008 and is expected to contract by less than 1.0% over the full year 2009 Second quarter growth registered 1.9% on an annualized basis, indicating a technical end to recession.\n",
      "Still, a number of indicators in the real economy remain weak and fiscal pressures from the stimulus package present a short-term financial burden.\n",
      "It also has some $200 billion in international reserves, which have served as an effective cushion against financial retreat from the financial markets.\n",
      "Brazil also has a sound and well-regulated banking system and experienced central bank leadership and staff that has helped maintain confidence in the financial system in the face of rising defaults and declining balance sheet quality.\n",
      "Brazilian government debt was upgraded from speculative to investment grade by the major ratings agencies in late September, lending further support for confidence in the country's financial and economic outlook.\n",
      "Brazil, however, has a large internal market and is well-positioned on the macroeconomic front, which has helped soften the effects of the global financial crisis.\n",
      "The Central Bank has injected billions of dollars into the banking system, lowered reserve requirements, and reduced the key short-term interest rate many times, from 13.75% to 8.75%.\n",
      "The Brazilian government has authorized state-owned banks to purchase private banks, approved stricter accounting rules for derivatives, extended credit directly to firms through the National Development Bank (BNDES) and the Central Bank, and exempted foreign investment firms from the financial transactions tax.\n",
      "Unibanco, one of Brazil's largest banks, has also procured a $60 million credit extension from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation to support trade financing.\n",
      "Argentina, because of its shaky economic and financial position at the outset of the crisis, has been poorly positioned to deal with a protracted downturn compared to most other Latin American countries.\n",
      "Although until recently it has experienced dramatic economic growth since 2002, this trend reflects a rebound from the previous severe 2001-2002 financial crisis and rise in commodity prices that benefitted Argentina's large agricultural sector.\n",
      "Economists forecast the economy will contract by 2% to 4% in 2009 and recovery will be slow with unemployment still rising to nearly 9.0% in the summer of 2009 Argentina has been financially isolated from global markets since its 2001 crisis and is also hampered by a litany of questionable policy choices, which combined with the global recession and a prolonged draught, has further diminished confidence in its financial system.\n",
      "Others include government interference in the supposedly independent government statistics office (particularly with respect to inflation reporting), price controls, high export taxes, and nationalization of private pension funds to bolster public finances.\n",
      "These policies have isolated the economy from international capital markets despite the need to finance a growing debt burden and public and private sector investments.\n",
      "Argentina's exports declined by 21% year-over-year in the first six months of 2009 In response to falling demand for Argentine exports and the government's questionable financial policies and position, Argentina's currency has depreciated by 20% from September 2008, in spite of exchange rate intervention.\n",
      "All these indicators point to a global perception of Argentina as a high-risk country, likely reinforcing its ostracism from international capital markets.\n",
      "Given Argentina's large expected public spending outlays for the coming year, the high and growing cost of its debt, falling revenues from imports, and its inability to access international credit markets, it had to take dramatic action to finance these programs.\n",
      "However, unlike the emerging economies of East Asia and some major developed economies, Russia's recovery from the crisis is proceeding slowly, reflecting fundamental structural problems, including a high dependence on production of oil and other commodities and a very weak banking system.\n",
      "The economic growth came to an abrupt end with the global financial crisis and recession, which led to a decline in demand for energy and thus in world oil prices.\n",
      "Declining revenues have forced the government to tighten fiscal policy but still incur budget deficits for the first time since 1999, a projected deficit of 8.0% of GDP by the end of 2009 And for the first time since 1998, the government will likely have to obtain budget financing through the international debt market but the size of the bond issue will depend on world oil prices which have begun to rise.\n",
      "The Russian government has responded to the crisis with various measures to prop up the stock market and the banks and to stimulate domestic demand.\n",
      "In mid-September 2008, the government made available $44 billion in funds to Russia's three largest state-owned banks to boost lending and another $16 billion to the next 25 largest banks.\n",
      "It also lowered taxes on oil exports to reduce costs to oil companies and made available $20 billion for the government to purchase stocks on the stock market.\n",
      "In late September 2008, the government announced that an additional $50 billion would be available to banks and Russian companies to pay off foreign debts coming due by the end of the year.\n",
      "On October 7, 2008, the government announced another package of $36.4 billion in credits to banks.\n",
      "Some European countries initially viewed the financial crisis as a purely American phenomenon.\n",
      "In addition, public protests, sparked by rising rates of unemployment and concerns over the growing financial and economic turmoil, have increased the political stakes for European governments and their leaders.\n",
      "Since the start of the financial crisis, the European Union has taken a number of steps to improve supervision of financial markets.\n",
      "Approved direct funding by the European Union to the International Accounting Standards Committee Foundation, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, and the Public Interest Oversight Body.\n",
      "European countries have been concerned over the impact the financial crisis and the economic recession are having on the economies of East Europe and prospects for political instability as well as future prospects for market reforms.\n",
      "Worsening economic conditions in East European countries are compounding the current problems facing financial institutions in the EU.\n",
      "The crisis has underscored the growing interdependence between financial markets and between the U.S and European economies.\n",
      "As such, the synchronized nature of the current economic downturn probably means that neither the United States nor Europe is likely to emerge from the financial crisis or the economic downturn alone.\n",
      "The United States and Europe share a mutual interest in developing a sound financial architecture to improve supervision and regulation of individual institutions and of international markets.\n",
      "This issue includes developing the organization and structures within national economies that can provide oversight of the different segments of the highly complex financial system.\n",
      "This oversight is viewed by many as critical to the future of the financial system because financial markets generally are considered to play an indispensible role in allocating capital and facilitating economic activity.\n",
      "Within Europe, national governments and private firms have taken noticeably varied responses to the crisis, reflecting the unequal effects by country.\n",
      "Iceland, on the other hand, had to take over three of its largest banks in an effort to save its financial sector and its economy from collapse.\n",
      "The Icelandic experience has raised important questions about how a nation can protect its depositors from financial crisis elsewhere and about the level of financial sector debt that is manageable without risking system-wide failure.\n",
      "According to reports by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB), many of the factors that led to the financial crisis in the United States created a similar crisis in Europe.\n",
      "Essentially low interest rates and an expansion of financial and investment opportunities that arose from aggressive credit expansion, growing complexity in mortgage securitization, and loosening in underwriting standards combined with expanded linkages among national financial centers to spur a broad expansion in credit and economic growth.\n",
      "Concerns over the pricing of risk in the market for subprime mortgage-backed securities spread to other financial markets, including to structured securities more generally and the interbank money market.\n",
      "Problems spread quickly throughout the financial sector to include financial guarantors as the markets turned increasingly dysfunctional over fears of under-valued assets.\n",
      "Another factor in the spread of the financial turmoil to Europe has been the linkages that have been formed between national credit markets and the role played by international investors who react to economic or financial shocks by rebalancing their portfolios in assets and markets that otherwise would seem to be unrelated.\n",
      "Estimates developed by the International Monetary Fund in January 2009 provide a rough indicator of the impact the financial crisis and an economic recession are having on the performance of major advanced countries.\n",
      "Economic growth, as represented by gross domestic product (GDP), is expected to register a negative 1.6% rate for the United States in 2009, while the euro area countries could experience a combined negative rate of 2.0%, down from a projected rate of growth of 1.2% in 2008 The drop in the prices of oil and other commodities from the highs reached in summer 2008 may have helped improve the rate of economic growth, but the length and depth of the economic downturn has challenged the ability of the IMF projections to accurately estimate projected rates of economic growth.\n",
      "Central banks in the United States, the Euro zone, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, and Switzerland staged a coordinated cut in interest rates on October 8, 2008, and announced they had agreed on a plan of action to address the ever-widening financial crisis.\n",
      "Many Europeans were surprised at the speed with which the financial crisis spread across national borders and the extent to which it threatened to weaken economic growth in Europe.\n",
      "It has demonstrated the global economic and financial linkages that tie national economies together in a way that may not have been imagined even a decade ago.\n",
      "At the Euro area summit on October 12, 2008, Euro area countries along with the United Kingdom urged all European governments to adopt a common set of principles to address the financial crisis.\n",
      "Government debt guarantees: guarantees offered for any new debts, including inter-bank loans, issued by the banks in the Euro zone area.\n",
      "In addition to these measures, EU leaders agreed on October 16, 2008, to set up a crisis unit and they agreed to a monthly meeting to improve financial oversight.\n",
      "Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, urged EU members to develop a \"fully integrated solution\" to address the global financial crisis, consistent with France's support for a strong international organization to oversee the financial markets.\n",
      "The EU members expressed their support for the current approach within the EU, which makes each EU member responsible for developing and implementing its own national regulations regarding supervision over financial institutions.\n",
      "As an alternative, the European Commission reportedly is considering adopting a set of rules for EU members that would require banks and other users of the CDS markets to use a central clearing house within the EU as a way of reducing risk.\n",
      "On October 29, 2008, the European Commission released a \"European Framework for Action\" as a way to coordinate the actions of the 27 member states of the European Union to address the financial crisis.\n",
      "The basis of this architecture involves implementing measures that member states have announced as well as providing for (1) continued support for the financial system from the European Central Bank and other central banks; (2) rapid and consistent implementation of the bank rescue plan that has been established by the member states; and (3) decisive measures that are designed to contain the crisis from spreading to all of the member states.\n",
      "The policy instruments member states can use to address the expected rise in unemployment and decline in economic growth as a second-round effect of the financial crisis are in the hands of the individual member states.\n",
      "A global response to the financial crisis.\n",
      "As a result, the crisis has raised questions concerning global governance not only relative to the financial sector, but the need to maintain open trade markets.\n",
      "The EU would like to use the November 15, 2008 multi-nation G-20 economic summit in Washington, DC, to promote a series of measures to reform the global financial architecture.\n",
      "The Commission argues that the measures should include (1) strengthening international regulatory standards; (2) strengthen international coordination among financial supervisors; (3) strengthening measures to monitor and coordinate macroeconomic policies; and (4) developing the capacity to address financial crises at the national regional and multilateral levels.\n",
      "European leaders, meeting prior to the November 15, 2008 G-20 economic summit in Washington, DC, agreed that the task of preventing future financial crisis should fall to the International Monetary Fund, but they could not agree on precisely what that role should be.\n",
      "British Prime Minister [author name scrubbed] reportedly urged other European leaders to back fiscal stimulus measure to support the November 6, 2008 interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other central banks.\n",
      "French and German officials have argued that the IMF should assume a larger role in financial market regulation, acting as a global supervisor of regulators.\n",
      "Other reports indicate that Germany is considering an emergency fund of up to 100 billion Euros in state-backed loans or guarantees to aid companies having problems getting credit.\n",
      "France, which has been leading efforts to develop a coordinated European response to the financial crisis, has proposed a package of measures estimated to cost over $500 billion.\n",
      "The package is focused primarily on infrastructure projects and investments by state-controlled firms, including a canal north of Paris, renovation of university buildings, new metro cars, and construction of 70,000 new homes, in addition to 30,000 unfinished homes the government has committed to buy in 2009 The plan also includes a 200 Euro payment to low-income households.\n",
      "When the European Union released its \"Framework for Action\" in response to the immediate needs of the financial crisis, it was moving to address the long-term requirements of the financial system.\n",
      "As part of this way forward, the European Union issued two reports in the first quarter of 2009 that address the issue of supervision of financial markets.\n",
      "The first report, issued on February 25, 2009 and commissioned by the European Union, was prepared by a High-Level Group on financial supervision headed by former IMF Managing Director and ex-Bank of France Governor Jacques de Larosiere and, therefore, is known as the de Larosiere Report.\n",
      "The second report was published by the European Commission to chart the course ahead for the members of the EU to reform the international financial governance system.\n",
      "The de Larosiere Report focuses on four main issues: (1) causes of the financial crisis; (2) organizing the supervision of financial institutions and markets in the EU; (3) strengthening European cooperation on financial stability, oversight, early warning, and crisis mechanisms; and (4) organizing EU supervisors to cooperate globally.\n",
      "The Report also proposes 31 recommendations on regulation and supervision of financial markets.\n",
      "As the financial crisis unfolded, the de Larosiere Report concludes, the regulatory response by the European Union and its members was weakened by, \"an inadequate crisis management infrastructure in the EU.\" Furthermore, the Report emphasizes that an inconsistent set of rules across the EU as a result of the closely guarded sovereignty of national financial regulators led to a wide diversity of national regulations reflecting local traditions, legislation, and practices.\n",
      "The de Larosiere Report recommends that the EU create a new macro-prudential level of supervision called the European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC) chaired by the President of the European Central Bank.\n",
      "A driving force behind creating the ESRC is that it would bring together the central banks of all of the EU members with a clear mandate to preserve financial stability by collectively forming judgments and making recommendations on macro-prudential policy.\n",
      "The recommendations in the report were intended to complement the economic stimulus measures that were adopted by the EU on November 27, 2008, under the $256 billion Economic Recovery Plan that funds cross-border projects, including investments in clean energy and upgraded telecommunications infrastructure.\n",
      "The plan is meant to ensure that, \"all relevant actors and all types of financial investments are subject to appropriate regulation and oversight.\" In particular, the EC plan notes that nation-based financial supervisory models are lagging behind the market reality of a large number of financial institutions that operate across national borders.\n",
      "The EC also supported the concept of a new European body similar to the proposed European Systemic Risk Council to gather and assess information on all risks to the financial sector as a whole, and it supported the concept of reforming the current system of EU Committees that oversee the financial sector.\n",
      "First, provide the EU with a supervisory framework that detects potential risks early, deals with them effectively before they have an impact, and meets the challenge of complex international financial markets.\n",
      "Second, the EC will move to reform those areas where European or national regulation is insufficient or incomplete by proposing: a comprehensive legislative instrument that establishes regulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds, private equity and other systemically important market players; a White Paper on the necessary tools for early intervention to prevent a similar crisis; measures to increase transparency and ensure financial stability in the area of derivatives and other complex structured products; legislative proposals to increase the quality and quantity of prudential capital for trading book activities, complex securitization, and to address liquidity risk and excessive leverage; and a program of actions to establish a more consistent set of supervisory rules.\n",
      "Third, to ensure European investors, consumers, and small and medium-size enterprises can be confident about their savings, their access to credit and their rights, the EC will: advance a Communication on retail investment products to strengthen the effectiveness of marketing safeguards; provide additional measures to reinforce the protection of bank depositors, investors, and insurance policy holders; and provide measures on responsible lending and borrowing.\n",
      "Fourth, in order to improve risk management in financial firms and align pay incentives with sustainable performance, the EC intends to strengthen the 2004 Recommendation on the remuneration of directors; and bring forward a new Recommendation on remuneration in the financial services sector followed by legislative proposals to include remuneration schemes within the scope of prudential oversight.\n",
      "On October 8, 2008, the British Government announced a $850 billion multi-part plan to rescue its banking sector from the current financial crisis.\n",
      "An announcement of an investment facility of $87 billion implemented in two stages to acquire the Tier 1 capital, or preferred stock, in \"eligible\" banks and building societies (financial institutions that specialize on mortgage financing) in order to recapitalize the firms.\n",
      "The British Government agreed to make available to those institutions participating in the recapitalization scheme up to $436 billion in guarantees on new short- and medium-term debt to assist in refinancing maturing funding obligations as they fall due for terms up to three years.\n",
      "The British Government announced that it would make available $352 billion through the Special Liquidity Scheme to improve liquidity in the banking industry.\n",
      "On November 24, 2008, Britain's majority Labor party presented a plan to Parliament to stimulate the nation's slowing economy by providing a range of tax cuts and government spending projects totaling 20 billion pounds (about $30 billion).\n",
      "On January 14, 2009, British Business Secretary Lord Mandelson unveiled an additional package of measures by the Labor government to provide credit to small and medium businesses that have been hard pressed for credit as foreign financial firms have reduced their level of activity in the UK.\n",
      "The three measures are: (1) a 10 billion pound (approximately $14 billion) Capital Working Scheme to provide banks with guarantees to cover 50% of the risk on existing and new working capital loans on condition that the banks must use money freed up by the guarantee to make new loans; (2) a one billion pound Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme to assist small, credit-worthy companies by providing guarantees to banks of up to 75% of loans to small businesses; and (3) a 75 million pound Capital for Enterprise Fund to convert debt to equity for small businesses.\n",
      "In an effort to address the prospect that large banks or financial firms may become insolvent or fail and thereby cause a major disruption to the financial system, the British Parliament in February 2009 passed the Banking Act of 2009 The act makes permanent a set of procedures the U.K government had developed to deal with troubled banks before they become insolvent or collapse.\n",
      "The failure of Iceland's banks has raised some questions about bank supervision and crisis management for governments in Europe and the United States.\n",
      "This incident raised questions about how national governments should address the issue of supervising foreign financial firms that are operating within their borders and whether they can prevent foreign-owned firms from withdrawing deposits in one market to offset losses in another.\n",
      "In addition, the case of Iceland raises questions about the cost and benefits of branch banking across national borders where banks can grow to be so large that disruptions in the financial market can cause defaults that outstrip the resources of national central banks to address.\n",
      "On November 19, 2008, Iceland and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) finalized an agreement on an economic stabilization program supported by a $2.1 billion two-year standby arrangement from the IMF.\n",
      "As part of the agreement, Iceland has proposed a plan to restore confidence in its banking system, to stabilize the exchange rate, and to improve the nation's fiscal position.\n",
      "Between October 7 and 9, 2008, Iceland's Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), an independent state authority with responsibilities to regulate and supervise Iceland's credit, insurance, securities, and pension markets took control, without actually nationalizing them, of three of Iceland's largest banks: Landsbanki, Glitnir Banki, and Kaupthing Bank prior to a scheduled vote by shareholders to accept a government plan to purchase the shares of the banks in order to head off the collapse of the banks.\n",
      "Some have argued that at the heart of Iceland's banking crisis is a flawed banking model that is based on an internationally active banking sector that is large relative to the size of the home country's GDP and to the fiscal capacity of the central bank.\n",
      "The financial crisis has also created problems with Great Britain because hundreds of thousands of Britons hold accounts in online branches of the Icelandic banks, and they fear those accounts will default.\n",
      "Although most observers say the region's economic fundamentals have improved greatly in the past decade, this crisis has provided a worrying sense of deja vu, and an illustration that Asian policy changes in recent yearsincluding Japan's slow but comprehensive banking reforms, Korea's opening of its financial markets, China's dramatic economic transformation, and the enormous buildup of sovereign reserves across the regionhave not fully insulated Asian economies from global contagion.\n",
      "Many observers have attributed this recovery to the rapid implementation of large fiscal and monetary stimulus programs that were possible because of the comparatively strong fiscal positions that most Asian governments were in, and the fact that many Asian banking systems are considered healthy.\n",
      "Still, Asian governments remain deeply concerned about the state of their economies, and those in countries whose economies depend heavily on exports worry about the sustainability of their recoveries if the United States and other developed economies recover more slowly.\n",
      "This has been reflected in bilateral relations between the United States and some, including China, whose officials are seen as increasingly assertive in their discussions with U.S economic officials on policies the United States should follow to emerge from the recession.\n",
      "In the early months of the crisis, Asian nations did not have to deal with outright bankruptcies or rescues of major financial institutions, as Western governments did.\n",
      "With only a few exceptionsmost notably in South Korealeverage within Asian financial systems was comparatively low and bank balance sheets were comparatively healthy at the outset of the crisis.\n",
      "Nearly all East Asian nations run current account surpluses, a reversal from their state during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.\n",
      "Such reserves have given Asian governments resources to provide fiscal stimulus, inject capital into their financial systems, and provide backstop guarantees for private financial transactions where needed.\n",
      "So overall, Asian economies were much healthier at the outset of the current crisis than they were before the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997-1998, when several Asian countries burned through their limited reserves quickly trying to defend currencies from speculative selling.\n",
      "The initial stage of the crisis, which centered around losses directly from subprime assets in the United States, gave way to a broader global crisis marked by slowing economies and dried-up liquidity.\n",
      "Asia and the United States are deeply linked in many ways, including trade (primarily Asian exports to the United States), U.S investments in the region, and financial linkages that entwine Asian banks, companies and governments with U.S markets and financial institutions.\n",
      "As a result, even though Asian banks disclosed relatively low direct exposures to failed institutions and toxic assets in the United States and Europe, Asian economies were caught in a second phase of the crisis.\n",
      "With Western economies slowing and global investors short of cash and pulling back from any markets deemed risky, many Asian economies suffered sharp slowdowns or dipped into recession in the fourth quarter of 2008 or the first quarter of 2009 However, several Asian countriesincluding China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singaporeimplemented large fiscal stimulus programs that have shown signs of stimulating domestic investment and consumption.\n",
      "China also mandated an easing of lending by its state banks, opening up credit lines that had been frozen in the crisis's early stages.\n",
      "Still, in Asia, a belief that held sway in recent years that Asian economies were starting to \"decouple\" from the United States and Europe, generating growth that didn't depend on the rest of the world, has given way to a realization that a crisis that originated in the West can sweep up the region as well.\n",
      "This points to the limits of bilateral solutions to the crisis: For much of October and early November, Pakistan reportedly sought support from China, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern states before being forced to the IMF.\n",
      "On November 13, well into discussions with the IMF, Pakistan officials announced they had received a $500 million aid package from Beijing, far short of the $10 billion-$15 billion that Pakistani leaders say they need over the next two years.\n",
      "Japan has contributed funding for the IMF support package of Iceland, and on November 14, 2008, Prime Minister Taro Aso said Japan would lend the IMF $100 billion to support further packages that might be needed before the IMF increases its capital in 2009 Many wonder if China and other reserve-rich developing nations will find ways to use those reserves to support financially-strapped governments.\n",
      "In late January, speaking at an annual gathering of economic and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, Wen blamed the crisis on an \"excessive expansion of financial institutions in blind pursuit of profit,\" a failure of government supervision in the financial sector, and an \"unsustainable model of development, characterized by prolonged low savings and high consumption.\" Many analysts saw this as a criticism of the United States, which has much lower savings and higher consumption rates than China.\n",
      "In 1998, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, Japan and the Asian Development Bank proposed the creation of an \"Asian Monetary Fund\" through which wealthier Asian governments could support economies in financial distress.\n",
      "Two years later, in 2000, Finance Ministers from the ASEAN+3 nations (the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, plus Japan, South Korea and China) announced the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI), whose primary measure was to provide a swap mechanism that countries could tap to cover shortfalls of foreign reserves.\n",
      "On October 26, Japan, China, South Korea, and ASEAN members agreed to start an $80 billion multilateral swap arrangement in 2009, which would allow countries with substantial balance of payments problems to tap the reserves of larger economies.\n",
      "On October 22, a Japanese government official floated the idea of a pan-Asian financial stability forum, modeled after the Financial Stability Forum at the BIS, which was discussed in May at a meeting of Finance Ministers from Japan, South Korea and China.\n",
      "Japan was part of the early moves among major economies to flood markets with liquidity, in the \"crisis containment\" part of the global response, and the Bank of Japan has continued its aggressive monetary stimulus in the months since.\n",
      "Alongside other major central banks, the Bank of Japan pumped tens of billions of dollars into financial markets in late September and early October.\n",
      "The BOJ did not lower interest rates in the crisis's early stages, but on October 31, it joined other global central banks, including the U.S Federal Reserve, by cutting a key short-term interest rate to 0.3%, from 0.5%, and on December 19 it cut the rate to 0.1%.\n",
      "Japan spent nearly $440 billion between 1998 and 2003 to assist and recapitalize its banking system, and most observers say Japan's financial system emerged from the experience fairly sound.\n",
      "Healthy capital positions helped Mitsubishi UFG Group, Japan's largest bank, and Nomura, the country's largest brokerage, to buy pieces of distressed U.S investment banks as the crisis was deepening in October.\n",
      "The U.S accounted for 20.1% of Japan's exports in 2007 Japan has sought to provide fiscal stimulus: The government unveiled a $107 billion stimulus package in August, and on January 27, the Japanese parliament passed a second package, valued at $54 billion.\n",
      "Most of Chinese investment flows are controlled by government entities, such as state-owned banks, State Administration of Foreign Exchange (which administers China's foreign exchange reserves), and the China Investment Corporation (a $200 billion sovereign wealth fund created in 2007), and state-owned enterprises.\n",
      "The Chinese government generally does not release detailed information on the holdings of its financial entities, although some of its banks have reported on their supposed level of exposure to sub-prime U.S mortgage securities.\n",
      "However, China's economy has not been immune to the effects of the global financial crisis, given its heavy reliance on trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) for its economic growth.\n",
      "That will be our greatest contribution to the world economy under the current circumstances.\" On October 8, 2008, China's central bank announced plans to cut interest rates and the reserve-requirement ratio in order to help stimulate the economy.\n",
      "The announcement coincided with announcements by the U.S Federal Reserve and other central banks of major economies around the world to lower their benchmark interest rates, although, neither China's central bank or the media stated that these measures were taken in conjunction with the other major central banks.\n",
      "On October 21, 2008, China's State Council announced it was considering implementing a new economic stimulus package, which would include an acceleration of construction projects, new export tax rebates, a reduction in the housing transaction tax, increased agriculture subsidies, and expanding lending to small and medium enterprises.\n",
      "On November 9, 2008 the Chinese government announced it would implement a two-year $586 billion stimulus package, mainly dedicated to infrastructure projects.\n",
      "It is estimated that Chinese banks made $1.27 trillion in new loans during the first nine months of 2009 China's stimulus package and easy monetary policies appear to have produced positive results for China's economy.\n",
      "Although China's trade in 2009 has not rebounded to 2008 growth levels, it has shown gradual growth since around February 2009 The IMF in October 2009 projected China's real GDP would rise by 8.5% in 2009 (and by 9.0% in 2010), a level significantly higher than most of the other major world economies (see Figure 12 ).\n",
      "Despite these positive growth projections, some economies warn that long-term economic growth will depend largely on the ability of the government to rebalance the economy away from trade and fixed investment to domestic consumption.\n",
      "Many have also raised concerns that easy money policies could lead to overcapacity n some industries, create asset bubbles in certain sectors, such as in real estate and the stock market, and result in a sharp increase in the amount of non-performing loans held by China's banks.\n",
      "For example, in June 2009, a Chinese government agency estimated that 20% of new bank credit was going into China's stock markets.\n",
      "The government announced a broad economic rescue package on October 19, 2008, promising to guarantee $100 billion in South Korean banks' foreign-currency debt and provide another $30 billion to directly support South Korean banks.\n",
      "(The total amount was equivalent to 14% of the country's GDP.) Struggling with its plunging stock market and currency, President Lee's government has also announced policies to spend up to $9.2 billion to support real-estate developers struggling with unsold apartments, and to provide further financial support to small businesses.\n",
      "On December 17, the government said it would launch a $15 billion fund to boost the capital of Korean banks.\n",
      "South Korea has been an enormous economic success, and has bounced back strongly from the Asian Financial Crisis that forced it to turn to the IMF for a $58 billion support package in December 2007 After contracting by 6.9% in 1998, South Korea's GDP bounced back by 9.5% and 8.5% in the ensuing two years.\n",
      "Its banks are unusually leveraged, with loan-deposit ratios of more than 130%, higher than that in the United States and the EU, and the only East Asian country over 100%.\n",
      "Pakistan's economy went into a steady decline in 2008 After several years of strong and comparatively stable growth, Pakistan quickly slid into a severe economic crisis in 2008 Growth in real GDP declined sharply from about 8% to 3-4%; inflation rose to nearly 24%; and Pakistan's rupee depreciated by over 23% against the U.S dollar.\n",
      "Rising trade and current account deficits generated a \"capital crisis\" in the autumn of 2008 Pakistan's foreign reserves slid from $14.2 billion in October 2007 to $4.1 billion at the end of October 2008 According to President Zardari's chief economic advisor, Shaukat Tarin, Pakistan needed $4 to $5 billion by the end of November 2008 to avoid defaulting on maturing sovereign debt obligations.\n",
      "In addition, even if Pakistan does secure the money it needs by the end of November, Tarin stated that Pakistan requires $10 to $15 billion in assistance over the next two to three years to continue to service its account deficits and outstanding debt.\n",
      "Several factors, in addition to the current global financial crisis, are contributing to the recent downturn in Pakistan's economy.\n",
      "In addition, the flight from risk that has followed the U.S financial crisis has apparently contributed to some capital flight from Pakistan, especially among overseas Pakistanis and investors from the Middle East.\n",
      "Pakistan has sought the required assistance from several countries (including China, Saudi Arabia, and the United States), international financial institutions (including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), and the World Bank), and an informal group of nations called the \"Friends of Pakistan.\" Although the ADB, the World Bank and others did offer some support, the total amount was insufficient to avoid the default risk.\n",
      "The first installment of the loanup to $4 billionwas expected by the end of November; Pakistan is to repay the loan by 2016 Assuming Pakistan and the IMF formally conclude the agreement, the $7.6 billion loan is well short of the estimated $10 billion to $15 billion Pakistan says it needs over the next two years to avoid a financial crisis.\n",
      "On September 19, 2008, acting finance minister Naveed Qamar released new economic policies designed to bring about macroeconomic stability and avoid seeking IMF assistance that included the elimination of fuel, electricity and food subsidies, and a reduction in the government deficit.\n",
      "For example, in Congressional testimony on October 23, 2008, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that a \"once-in-a-century credit tsunami\"' had engulfed financial markets, and he conceded that his free-market ideology shunning regulation was flawed.\n",
      "Could this crisis mark the beginning of the end of \"free market capitalism?\" On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund has observed that market discipline still works and that the focus of new regulations should not be on eliminating risk but on improving market discipline and addressing the tendency of market participants to underestimate the systemic effects of their collective actions.\n",
      "Should enforcement be done through a dispute resolution process similar to that in the World Trade Organization, or should the IMF or other international institution be ceded oversight and regulatory authority by national governments?\n",
      "The IMF has been tracking economic and financial developments worldwide in order to provide policymakers with forecasts and analysis of developments in financial markets.\n",
      "It also is providing policy advice to countries and regions and is assisting the Group of 20 and other international organizations with recommendations to reshape the system of international regulation and governance.\n",
      "In the declaration of the G-20 Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy, world leaders stated:\n",
      "The G-20 is an informal forum that promotes open and constructive discussion between industrial and emerging-market countries on key issues related to global economic stability.\n",
      "In order to achieve this framework, the G-20 members agreed to implement a \"cooperative process of mutual assessment.\" This cooperative process is comprised of: shared policy objectives; a medium-term policy framework and an assessment of the impact national policies have on global economic growth and financial stability; and actions to meet common objectives.\n",
      "implement responsible fiscal policies, attentive to short-term flexibility considerations and longer-run sustainability requirements; strengthen financial supervision to prevent the re-emergence in the financial system of excess credit growth and excess leverage and undertake macro prudential and regulatory policies to help prevent credit and asset price cycles from becoming forces of destabilization; promote more balanced current accounts and support open trade and investment to advance global prosperity and growth sustainability, while actively rejecting protectionist measures; undertake monetary policies consistent with price stability in the context of market oriented exchange rates that reflect underlying economic fundamentals; undertake structural reforms to increase potential growth rates and, where needed, to improve social safety nets; and promote balanced and sustainable economic development in order to narrow development imbalances and reduce poverty.\n",
      "2 To strengthen the regulatory system for banks and other financial firms by raising capital standards, implementing strong international compensation standards, improving the over-the-counter derivatives market, and holding large global firms accountable for their risks.\n",
      "As components of this process, the G-20 agree to: building high quality bank capital and mitigating procyclical actions; reforming compensation practices to strengthen financial stability; improving over-the-counter derivatives markets; and addressing cross-border resolutions and systemically important financial institutions.\n",
      "In addition, the G-20 leaders indicated their support for efforts to improve the financial system by taking actions against non-cooperative jurisdictions, including using \"countermeasures against tax havens,\" and by tasking the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to issue a list of high risk jurisdictions by February 2010 3 To modernize the global architecture by designating the G-20 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, by establishing the Financial Stability Board (FSB), by having the FSB include major emerging economies, and by having the FSB coordinate and monitor progress in strengthening financial regulation.\n",
      "The G-20 also called for reforming the mission, mandate, and governance of the development banks, including the IMF, which the G-20 indicated must play a \"critical role in promoting global financial stability and rebalancing growth.\" They also called on the World Bank to play a leading role in responding to problems whose nature requires globally coordinated action, such as climate change and green technology, food security, human development, and private-sector led growth.\n",
      "In addition, the G-20 countries are addressing a number of issues related to correcting abuses in the financial markets, particularly those involving non-bank financial institutions and complex financial instruments.\n",
      "Analysts and policymakers generally agree that the lack of regulation of new non-bank financial institutions, such as hedge funds and private equity firms, and the lack of transparency of new complex financial instruments, such as derivatives, were key factors in the current financial crisis.\n",
      "These principles include: strengthening the transparency and accountability of firms and financial products, extending regulation to all financial market institutions, promoting the integrity of financial markets (such as bolstering consumer protection) and consistent regulations across national borders, and reforming international financial institutions to better monitor the health of the financial system.\n",
      "The role of the G-20 in dealing with the global financial crisis began on November 15, 2008, with the G-20 Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy that was held in Washington, DC.\n",
      "This was billed as the first in a series of meetings to deal with the financial crisis, discuss efforts to strengthen economic growth, and to lay the foundation to prevent future crises from occurring.\n",
      "This summit included emerging market economies rather than the usual G-7 or G-8 nations that periodically meet to discuss economic issues.\n",
      "The G-20 Washington Declaration to address the current financial crisis was both a laundry list of objectives and steps to be taken and a convergence of attitudes by national leaders that concrete measures had to be implemented both to stabilize national economies and to reform financial markets.\n",
      "At the April 2009 G-20 London Summit, leaders agreed on establishing a new Financial Stability Board (incorporating the Financial Stability Forum) to work with the IMF to ensure cooperation across borders; closer regulation of banks, hedge funds, and credit rating agencies; and a crackdown on tax havens.\n",
      "The leaders could not agree on the need for additional stimulus packages by nations, but they considered the additional funding for the IMF and multilateral development banks as key stimulus directed at developing and emerging market economies.\n",
      "Enhancing sound regulation by ensuring strong oversight of credit rating agencies; prudent risk management; and oversight or regulation of all financial markets, products, and participants as appropriate to their circumstances.\n",
      "Reinforcing international cooperation by making national laws and regulations more consistent and encouraging regulators to enhance their coordination and cooperation across all segments of financial markets.\n",
      "Reforming international financial institutions (IFIs) by modernizing their governance and membership so that emerging market economies and developing countries have greater voice and representation, by working together to better identify vulnerabilities and anticipate stresses, and by acting swiftly to play a key role in crisis response.\n",
      "Address weaknesses in accounting and disclosure standards for off-balance sheet vehicles; Ensure that credit rating agencies meet the highest standards and avoid conflicts of interest, provide greater disclosure to investors, and differentiate ratings for complex products; Ensure that firms maintain adequate capital, and set out strengthened capital requirements for banks' structured credit and securitization activities; Develop enhanced guidance to strengthen banks' risk management practices, and ensure that firms develop processes that look at whether they are accumulating too much risk; Establish processes whereby national supervisors who oversee globally active financial institutions meet together and share information; and Expand the Financial Stability Forum to include a broader membership of emerging economies.\n",
      "Avoiding regulatory policies that exacerbate the ups and downs of the business cycle; Reviewing and aligning global accounting standards, particularly for complex securities in times of stress; Strengthening transparency of credit derivatives markets and reducing their systemic risks; Reviewing incentives for risk-taking and innovation reflected in compensation practices; and Reviewing the mandates, governance, and resource requirements of the International Financial Institutions.\n",
      "The leaders agreed that needed reforms will be successful only if they are grounded in a commitment to free market principles, including the rule of law, respect for private property, open trade and investment, competitive markets, and efficient, effectively-regulated financial systems.\n",
      "Reject protectionism, which exacerbates rather than mitigates financial and economic challenges; Strive to reach an agreement this year on modalities that leads to an ambitious outcome to the Doha Round of World Trade Organization negotiations; Refrain from imposing any new trade or investment barriers for the next 12 months; and Reaffirm development assistance commitments and urge both developed and emerging economies to undertake commitments consistent with their capacities and roles in the global economy.\n",

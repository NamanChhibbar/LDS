If smaller programs were included, the overall number of programs would be larger, but the analysis would essentially be unchanged. Medicaid replaced two earlier programs of federal grants to states that provided medical care to welfare recipients and the elderly. The credit has been expanded several times over the past 30 years and is currently one of the largest cash assistance programs for low-income households, reflecting the prevailing policy goal of \"make work pay.\" Figure 2 displays FY2008 and FY2009 spending by category, and also highlights the portion of spending in FY2009 attributable to ARRA. Some large entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)) saw additional growth in spending beyond that provided under ARRA, likely due to an increase in eligible and enrolled individuals as a result of the economic downturn. Spending for food assistance rose by almost $19 billion between FY2008 and FY2009. However, ARRA was enacted before final decisions were made on total FY2009 appropriations, so appropriators were able to take into consideration the additional amounts already provided through ARRA. In an open-ended entitlement program, no predetermined ceiling is imposed on federal expenditures; instead, federal payments are made to all eligible beneficiaries for eligible expenditures as defined in law. (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families is an example of a capped entitlement program.) While the program does not target benefits to certain demographic groups, nearly half of SNAP recipients in FY2009 were children and another 8% were age 60 or older. These are Pell Grants (which also includes a mandatory component), Title I-A of ESEA, and housing vouchers. Specific dollar amounts are used to define eligibility for SSI and also to determine when EITC benefits begin to phase out. TANF allocates block grants to states according to a formula that considers their spending patterns under the predecessor Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program. Section Overview of Benefits and Services by Category:\\n\\nThe following sections provide brief overviews of the programs included in each major category of benefits and services, organized by size of spending in FY2009. Section Health Care:\\n\\nAs health care dominates federal spending on benefits and services for people with limited income, Medicaid dominates spending within the health care category. These temporary programs offered grants to states in lieu of tax credits and provided capital investments for owners of certain LIHTC-financed properties. Title I-A provides grants to local educational agencies with high concentrations of disadvantaged children and aims to ensure that all children have an opportunity to obtain a high-quality education and reach at least minimum proficiency on challenging academic achievement standards. The Bureau of Indian Education operates several programs to meet the educational needs of Indian children living on or near reservations. Services funded by TANF are the largest single activity in this category, accounting for almost a quarter of social services spending in this report. The section looks at use of the federal poverty guidelines, as well as other measures of economic need used to define eligibility such as specific dollar amounts, percentages of area or state median income, and the \"need analysis\" system used for postsecondary student aid. Job Corps limits eligibility to those with income no higher than 100% of FPG; however, certain groups qualify automatically. Both adult and youth activities under WIA also allow automatic eligibility for specified groups. Veterans\\' benefits and SSI adjustments are tied to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs); and EITC is adjusted for price changes through indexing to the Consumer Price Index. However, 75% of the Section 8 vouchers that become available each year must go to \"extremely low-income\" people, defined as those with income no higher than 30% of area median. Similarly, Public Housing serves low-income families (80% of area median) but at least 40% of units that become available each year must go to extremely low-income families (30% of area median). As noted above, these programs use a relative concept to determine the amount of aid a student is eligible to receive. In the cash assistance category, asset rules apply to pensions for needy veterans and to the SSI program. While housing programs do not have asset tests, several impute a certain amount of income from assets. The Maternal and Child Health block grant allocates funds according to states\\' relative shares of funding under predecessor programs, and according to their population of low-income children. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program bases allocations on each state\\'s number of foster children; the Emergency Food and Shelter Program allocates funds to local jurisdictions based on their number of unemployed persons; and SSBG allocates funds according to total state population. The rural Water and Waste Disposal program varies the amount of federal support provided by the income level of the community served. Under this approach, funding is not necessarily distributed nationwide, but only to areas or entities meeting specified criteria. An exception is the Emergency Food and Shelter Program, which allocates funding among eligible local jurisdictions and makes grants to local boards in those jurisdictions. Competitive awards are less common than formula grants among federal benefits and services for limited-income populations. These grants are awarded by the federal government directly to public and private nonprofit agencies through a competitive process. Matching grants are generally designed in one of two ways. More typically, matching programs require grantees to demonstrate that they can provide nonfederal resources equal to a percentage of the federal grant, but the federal government is not necessarily reimbursing grantees for expenditures already incurred. As noted above, some programs use maintenance-of-effort (MOE) requirements to ensure a minimum level of nonfederal spending. For example, rental assistance is a function of both family income and the fair market rent of a particular housing unit. The table shows maximum TANF cash benefits for states with the highest benefits (Alaska) and with the lowest benefits (Tennessee for family size of two, Mississippi for family size of three). As for the level of participation in federal low-income programs, the fact sheets in Appendix C provide very limited data, primarily to give a sense of scope for each program. Budget authority in turn allows federal agencies to incur obligations , through actions such as entering into contracts, employing personnel, and submitting purchase orders. Outlays represent the actual payment of these obligations, usually in the form of electronic transfers or checks issued by the Treasury Department. However, this report uses different methodologies to select and categorize programs and measure spending; therefore, the current report cannot be considered an update of Cash and Noncash for various reasons. Table B -3 shows the type of federal assistance provided (typically formula grants, competitive or discretionary grants, or direct benefits) and the immediate recipients of this assistance. Some veterans also may receive long-term care, including nursing home care, domiciliary care, adult day care, and limited dental care. Allocation formula: Not applicable.
